This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for metadata. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

The Excel workbook is intented to facilitate compilation of metadata content according to the USGIN Recommended Metadata Model (http://repository.usgin.org/uri_gin/usgin/dlio/335). Usage and metadata content are described on the 'Notes' worksheet. Metadata records can be assembled and checked using the 'Metadata Template' worksheet. Content loaded into the template will be transformed to ISO19139 XML metadata records for the NGDS catalog system, but could be transformed to other formats as well. Field names in the template worksheet are similar to the XML element names in the ISO19139 schema, but not equivalent. Mapping from the columns in the spreadsheet to the ISO XML schema is indicated in the FieldList worksheet (right-most column).
